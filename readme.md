# PMPP Exercise 1: GPU Image Filtering

## Overview
This project implements **CPU and GPU versions** of common image filtering operations:
- **Grayscale conversion**
- **Convolution with a filter kernel**
- **Histogram computation**

GPU operations are implemented using **CUDA** for parallel processing.

The project is structured to work both on a local machine and on the university cluster.
